# MixZaTape

A terminal Songza player. There's no better way to rock out than terminal window.

## Installation

1. Download and install the [VLC player](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)
2. Add the VLC executable to your path.
	* For Mac OSX, it will be the path to the app bundle contents. Assuming a default install, add this line to your .bash_login: PATH=/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS:$PATH
3. Make sure the path addition worked by typing "vlc" in the terminal; this should open VLC.
4. Clone this repository.
5. Execute the player file (`python mixzatape.py` or `chmod +x` it first).
